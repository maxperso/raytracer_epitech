# RayTracer EPITECH 2023
**Second year project at Epitech.**

*Name: Raytracer*
*Language: C++*

## Description

Raytracer is a feature-rich program that implements ray tracing, a technique used to generate realistic digital images by simulating the inverse path of light. The program can generate images from a file that describes the scene configuration. It supports various primitives, transformations, lights, materials, and scene setup options to create visually appealing and detailed renderings.

## Features

_Mandatory:_

* Primitives: Supports spheres and planes.
* Transformations: Includes translation.
* Light: Provides directional light and ambient light.
* Material: Supports flat color.
* Scene Configuration: Allows adding primitives to the scene, setting up lighting, and configuring the camera.
* Interface: No graphical user interface (GUI), outputs images in PPM file format.

_Should:_

* Primitives: Supports cylinders and cones.
* Transformations: Includes rotation.
* Light: Enables drop shadows.

_Could:_

* Primitives: Supports limited cylinders, limited cones, torus, tangle cube, triangles, and loading OBJ files.
* Fractals: Provides options for fractal shapes such as MÃ¶bius strip.
* Transformations: Includes scaling, shearing, transformation matrices, and scene graph for hierarchical transformations.
* Light: Supports multiple directional lights, multiple point lights, colored light, and the Phong reflection model.
* Material: Includes transparency, refraction, reflection, texturing from files, procedural generation of a chessboard texture, Perlin noise texture, and normal mapping.
* Scene Configuration: Allows importing a scene within a scene, setting up anti-aliasing through super-sampling or adaptive super-sampling, and implementing optimizations such as space partitioning, multithreading, and clustering.

_Interface:_

* Provides the option to display the image during and after generation.
* Supports the option to exit during or after image generation.
* Offers a scene preview using a basic and fast renderer.
* Supports automatic reload of the scene when the file changes.

## How to use

*Compilation*

```bash
make
```

*Execution*

```bash
./raytracer [scene]
```
